1,Tri,5.0 ,These headphones are a bargain for under thirty,"
Literally had to write this review after getting my hands on these headphones. For under thirty bucks delivered to your door, you get a very capable Bluetooth headset. Countless hours searching various forums and social media suggestions brought me nowhere close to what these do for a fraction of the price of most.  These are easily the equivalent to lower end Anker Soundcore headphones (which isn't saying much) but I can see where they saved costs comparatively. Unlike other headphones, these don't have an APP you can use to change EQ settings or store custom ones. You also don't get a carrying case with these either, just the headphones themselves. ANC is really basic; enough to muffle everything around you but not precisely filter out any range specifically. Build quality is ""solid but plastic"", typical of headphones sub $80. Fit is a bit small too, but not uncomfortable at all.Another reviewer complained about the bass these push out, but I had no issues with it. It's a default flat sound curve, and mids were especially pronounced. I think the other reviewer was looking for V-shaped phones specifically, but that's understandable and a personal preference. These are excellent for podcasts or audiobooks if you're into that. The bass response does have a little bit of awkwardness in it (fade loud then soft), so bass heads might want to try something else if that's what they're really looking for (I suggest the new Anker H30i - cheap and cheerful heavy bass response)Either way these are a real bargain. I'm thinking of picking up a backup pair in another color.

2,Jan N,4.0 ,Very good headphones,"
I like these because they are lightweight and I  can wear them for a long time without  discomfort. Very good sound, easy to use and connect through Bluetooth. They hold a charge for many hours and have a good range between the transmitting device and the headset. Great price. I've only had them a couple of months  with no problems. Fingers crossed for a long term relationship.

3,Jaci,5.0 ,Very happy with these,"
Great value (so far). Sound quality is good (for me at least, I'm no audiophile). Happy with the battery life and overall comfort. I use these for working out and for general noise-muffling. Really like the white noise quality, kind of sounds like a fan is running when they are on but you aren't listening to anything (in fact I personally prefer it to turning on the ANC feature).

4,Customer,5.0 ,Punches above it's weight,"
When I bought this, I wasn't expecting much. I needed a new pair of headphones, and didn't feel like spending a lot. I did a lot of looking and decided to go with these. I wanted something to watch TV with at night (we use a small computer as a HTPC, so Bluetooth is good). But if I don't decide to buy something better by the next time I fly, having Active Noise Canceling was going to be a nice touch. I wasn't expecting much, but it's actually not bad. The drone of airplane engines will probably extinguished  It also has pass through, but it sounds weird, with lots of artifacting. It's better to just take the headphones off, and easier to understand someone talking to you as well.Sound is good. I don't listen to a lot of music with them, but I have no complaint for listening to the TV with it. It also has very little bleed, so my wife doesn't have to yell at me for listening to something she can hear.Build quality? It's not ""really"" cheap, but it's not ""high"" quality, either. For what you pay, they are fine. If you take good care of them (as I do) they should last. But I can see leaving them in the wrong place and someone stepping on them, or sitting on them, and them breaking in some way. So be nice to them, and they will be nice to you.All in all, I can't be unhappy with them for what I paid. They were basic headphones I would use temporarily, but I'm keeping them for now. They impressed me that much.

5,rabar,3.0 ,You get what you pay for!,"
I really like the price of these headphones.  I wanted something with bluetooth that weren't ear buds.  These headphones work alright.  The problem is with connecting to Zoom meetings; I often get a message that they aren't working properly.  This is easy enough (though annoying) to fix, as I just go into the Zoom audio, switch it to the computer's speaker and mic, and then switch both back to the headphones, and then everything works fine.  But I have to do this almost every time I'm on Zoom, and I use it at least twice a day.  As for the noise-cancelling, I don't really use it, but I tried it--it's just a sound of static (white noise), but I don't have experience with other noise-cancelling headphones, so I don't know if they are all like that or not.  Either way, I wasn't impressed, but that's not why I bought them.  The bluetooth starts breaking up if the computer is in the living room and I go into the bedroom (about 25 ft away).  It always breaks up if the microwave is on and I'm in the kitchen, but I guess that's kind of expected with any electronics (reminds me of vacuuming with the TV on back in the day).  The sound is rather good, but I don't listen to music or play video games, so I can't really say whether it would be good for that.  The mic works well, as long as everything is working properly.  The battery lasts for a good while, although when I plug them in to charge, the headphones disconnect from the device and I can't use them while they're charging.  They serve my purpose, but I wouldn't recommend them.  If you can afford to get name-brand, then go for it.

6,"""Badger""",5.0 ,"Great, comfortable noise cancelling headset.","
For the price, I thought I'd give it a try.  It's great!  Has 3 sound settings.  Noise cancelling - which does a very good job.  A listening mode - which allows ambient sounds to come in through headphones.  You can use this to talk/listen without taking headset off.  3rd - off, though it does offer some sound blocking.I've used top-of-the-line noise cancelling headsets.  They're great, but very expensive.  This item compares very well to the top models.  Not quite as good, but darn close.  This one is adjustable, lightweight and comfortable.The audio quality is very good.  A very minor complaint:  I'd like to be able to turn the volume up a little higher, as it tops out below my 'blast a good song' desired setting.  But, it's probably better for my hearing in the long run anyway.  Blue tooth paring worked with my iPhone easily.  No cord to fuss with.  But if you have a device without blue tooth, there IS a cord option, a nice featureCharged it up and used this on 3 1/2 hour flights, plus airport waiting use, round trip.  Never had to charge it during trip.  Ear cushion speakers fold in to make it easier to pack away.  I would have liked a carry case, but that would raise the price - and I was able to use a different case I had anyway.Great for travel, or home use.  Very nice, economical ANR headset.

7,Smart Shopper,5.0 ,"Great for the price, no bass, adequate noise canceling.","
I needed some headphones for mowing the lawn, these fit the bill. Bass is almost non existent, noise canceling works as it should for this price point. If you're an audiophile, these are not for you. If you're looking for a cheap pair of headphones with adequate noise canceling and long battery life then look no further!  Great headphones for under $30. Highly recommended!

8,Amazon Customer,5.0 ,"No need to read, just buy it now!","
I have several pairs of more expensive headphones and ear buds, but these get the job done at a price you can't beat.  The bluetooth connectivity works fantastic.  I usually leave these at work and every day when I turn them on the multpoint connectivity kicks right in and connects to both my phone and my laptop, and they stay connected.The range is excellent, buttons intuitive, battery life excellent, speed of transfer when I'm streaming music or video on PC and receive a call on my cell near instant, sound quality for music/video good to very good IMO - for calls fantastic both what you hear and what the person on the other end hears, transparency seems great, noise canceling ehh passable.  Only complaint at this price point is I would've gladly paid a few extra bucks for a case for when I wanna take them with me, but like I said I pretty much got these to leave at my work station anyway.

9,Intabus,4.0 ,Very good sound. Somewhat fragile.,"
I'm not an audiophile, so I am not very knowledgeable on what sounds the best. But these headphones have great bass and clear tones making it easy to hear lyrics or audio books. The noise canceling is awesome, and the pass through mode amplifies sounds so you can hear better than normal while still listening to your media.Bluetooth connectivity is great and easy to set up on multiple devices. Range is decent. Battery lasts for hours and hours, I never drained them so I don't know how long I could go but it was at least 6 with constant noise canceling and media.The con is that they are cheaply made. Only had ours for a few months, and my son leaned over to pick something up and they fell off his head and broke. The clips holding the ear cup snapped. No way to repair it since they use 6 small plastic clips to hold it on, and two of them broke off.Overall for the price these are a great value and if you are careful they should last a long time.
